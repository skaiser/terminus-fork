## TerminusGo: Building Interactive Text UIs in Your Browser

**Welcome to TerminusGo!**

TerminusGo is a Go framework for building rich, interactive terminal-style user interfaces that run directly in a web browser. If you love the simplicity and power of command-line applications (like those built with `Charmbracelet`'s Bubble Tea) and want to bring that experience to the web without wrestling with complex HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript, TerminusGo is for you!

**Philosophy:**

*   **Go All the Way:** Write your UI logic entirely in Go.
*   **Text-First:** Embrace the power and clarity of text-based interfaces.
*   **React/Elm Inspired:** Utilize a familiar component-based architecture based on Model-View-Update.
*   **Minimal Client:** A thin JavaScript client in the browser handles rendering and input, keeping the focus on your Go code.
*   **Developer Joy:** Making TUI-style web apps should be fun and productive.

**How it Works Under the Hood (Briefly):**

Your TerminusGo application runs as a Go server. When a user connects via their browser:
1.  A minimal HTML page with a JavaScript "terminal emulator" client is served.
2.  This client establishes a WebSocket connection back to your Go application.
3.  Your Go components manage state and render their view as styled text.
4.  This text output is sent over the WebSocket to the client, which renders it.
5.  User input (keystrokes) is sent from the client to the server, processed by your Go components, leading to state updates and re-renders.

**Core Concepts**

TerminusGo is built around a few key ideas, inspired by the Elm Architecture and React:

1.  **`Model`**: A Go struct that holds the entire state of your component. It's immutable in the sense that the `Update` function returns a *new* model.
2.  **`View()`**: A Go method that takes the current `Model` and returns a `string` representing what the UI should look like. This string can contain special sequences for styling.
3.  **`Update(msg Message)`**: A Go method that takes the current `Model` and an incoming `Message` (e.g., a key press, a tick event), and returns the new `Model` and an optional `Command`.
4.  **`Component`**: The basic building block. It's a Go type that implements the `terminus.Component` interface, typically by defining `Init()`, `Update()`, and `View()` methods.
5.  **`Message`**: Represents an event that can trigger a state change (e.g., keyboard input, data loaded, timer tick).
6.  **`Command` (Cmd)**: Represents a side effect you want to perform (e.g., make an HTTP request, wait for a tick). Commands are processed by the TerminusGo runtime, and their results are fed back into the `Update` function as new `Message`s.

**Getting Started**

**1. Installation (Hypothetical)**

```bash
go get github.com/skaiser/terminusgo # Or wherever it would live
```

**2. Your First TerminusGo App: "Hello, Terminus!"**

Let's create a simple app that displays a message and allows you to quit by pressing 'q'.

**Project Structure:**

```
myterminusapp/
├── main.go
└── hello_component.go
```

**`main.go`:**

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"myterminusapp/components" // Assuming your component is in a sub-package
	"github.com/skaiser/terminusgo"
)

func main() {
	// Create your root component
	initialModel := components.NewHelloModel()
	rootComponent := components.NewHelloComponent(initialModel)

	// Create a new TerminusGo program
	program := terminusgo.NewProgram(rootComponent)

	// Start the server. This will block.
	// Users can connect by navigating to http://localhost:8080
	log.Println("Listening on :8080...")
	if err := program.Start(":8080"); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Oh no! Could not start TerminusGo program: %v", err)
	}
}
```

**`components/hello_component.go`:** (We'll define `HelloModel` and `HelloComponent` here)

```go
package components

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/skaiser/terminusgo"
	"github.com/skaiser/terminusgo/style" // For styling
)

// --- Model ---
type HelloModel struct {
	message string
}

func NewHelloModel() HelloModel {
	return HelloModel{message: "Hello, TerminusGo User!"}
}

// --- Component ---
type HelloComponent struct {
	model HelloModel
}

func NewHelloComponent(model HelloModel) *HelloComponent {
	return &HelloComponent{model: model}
}

// Init is called once when the component is first created.
func (c *HelloComponent) Init() terminusgo.Cmd {
	// No initial command needed for this simple example
	return nil
}

// Update handles incoming messages and updates the model.
func (c *HelloComponent) Update(msg terminusgo.Msg) (terminusgo.Component, terminusgo.Cmd) {
	switch msg := msg.(type) {
	case terminusgo.KeyMsg:
		switch msg.String() {
		case "q", "ctrl+c":
			// This command tells the program to quit
			return c, terminusgo.Quit
		}
	}
	// If the message wasn't handled, return the current component and no command
	// For more complex components, you'd update c.model here and return the new state.
	return c, nil
}

// View renders the component's current state as a string.
func (c *HelloComponent) View() string {
	quitInstructions := style.New().Faint(true).Render("(Press 'q' to quit)")
	return fmt.Sprintf("%s\n\n%s", c.model.message, quitInstructions)
}
```

**3. Running Your App**

```bash
cd myterminusapp
go run main.go
```
Now, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see your "Hello, TerminusGo User!" message. Press 'q' to quit the application (which will stop the server).

**Building Your UI with TerminusGo**

**1. Defining Components**

As seen above, a component typically involves:
*   A `Model` struct.
*   A constructor for the model.
*   A component struct that usually holds the model.
*   A constructor for the component.
*   Implementations for `Init()`, `Update(terminusgo.Msg) (terminusgo.Component, terminusgo.Cmd)`, and `View() string`.

    *   **`Init() terminus.Cmd`**: Called when the component starts. Useful for initial setup or firing off an initial command (e.g., load data).
    *   **`Update(msg terminus.Msg) (terminus.Component, terminus.Cmd)`**: The heart of your component. It processes messages, changes the model, and can issue new commands. It *must* return a component (usually itself, with an updated model) and a command.
    *   **`View() string`**: Returns the string representation of your UI.

**2. Rendering Content**

*   **Basic Text:** Your `View()` method returns a string. Newlines (`\n`) create new lines in the terminal display.
*   **Styling Text:** Use the `terminusgo/style` package.
    ```go
    import "github.com/skaiser/terminusgo/style"

    func (c *MyComponent) View() string {
        s := style.New()
        title := s.Bold(true).Foreground(style.Color("magenta")).Render("My Awesome Title")
        warning := s.Background(style.Color("yellow")).Foreground(style.Color("black")).Render("WARNING!")
        return title + "\n" + warning
    }
    ```
    *   Available styles: `Bold`, `Faint`, `Italic`, `Underline`, `CrossOut`, `Foreground`, `Background`. Colors can be named (e.g., "red", "blue") or hex codes (e.g., "#FF0000").
*   **Layout Helpers (Conceptual - TerminusGo might provide some):**
    While you primarily work with strings, TerminusGo could offer helpers for common layout tasks (like boxes or columns), or you could use string manipulation libraries.
    ```go
    import "github.com/skaiser/terminusgo/layout" // Hypothetical

    func (c *MyComponent) View() string {
        content := "This is inside a box."
        // Box function might take content and styling options
        return layout.Box(content, layout.BoxStyle{Padding: 1, BorderStyle: layout.RoundedBorder})
    }
    ```

**3. Handling Input**

*   Keyboard input comes as `terminusgo.KeyMsg`.
    ```go
    func (c *MyComponent) Update(msg terminusgo.Msg) (terminusgo.Component, terminusgo.Cmd) {
        switch msg := msg.(type) {
        case terminusgo.KeyMsg:
            switch msg.Type {
            case terminusgo.KeyEnter:
                // Handle Enter key
                c.model.text += "\n"
                return c, nil
            case terminusgo.KeyBackspace:
                // Handle Backspace
                if len(c.model.text) > 0 {
                    c.model.text = c.model.text[:len(c.model.text)-1]
                }
                return c, nil
            case terminusgo.KeyRunes: // For character input
                c.model.text += string(msg.Runes)
                return c, nil
            case terminusgo.KeyCtrlC, terminusgo.KeyEsc:
                 return c, terminusgo.Quit
            }
            // For specific keys like 'a', 'b', 'q':
            if msg.String() == "s" {
                // Save something
                // return c, c.saveCmd() // Example of returning a command
            }
        }
        return c, nil
    }
    ```
*   Mouse support could be a future addition, sending `terminusgo.MouseMsg`.

**4. Built-in Widgets (Hypothetical)**

To save you from reinventing the wheel, TerminusGo could provide pre-built, customizable components:

*   `widgets.TextInput`: For single-line text input.
    ```go
    // In your model
    inputField widgets.TextInputModel

    // In Init()
    c.model.inputField = widgets.NewTextInput()
    c.model.inputField.Placeholder = "Enter your name..."
    c.model.inputField.Focus() // Important to receive input

    // In Update(), pass messages to the widget:
    var cmd terminusgo.Cmd
    c.model.inputField, cmd = c.model.inputField.Update(msg)
    cmds = append(cmds, cmd) // Collect commands from widgets

    // In View()
    view += c.model.inputField.View()
    ```
*   `widgets.List`: For scrollable lists of items.
*   `widgets.Spinner`: For indicating activity.
*   `widgets.Table`: For tabular data.

These widgets would manage their own internal state and expose `Update` and `View` methods, fitting neatly into your component's structure.

**5. Focus Management**

For interactive elements like text inputs, only one can be "focused" at a time to receive keyboard input. Widgets would have `Focus()` and `Blur()` methods. Your parent component would manage which widget is currently focused.

**6. Commands: Interacting with the Outside World (`terminusgo.Cmd`)**

Commands are how you tell TerminusGo to do things that have side effects. Your `Update` function returns a `Cmd`. TerminusGo executes the command, and if the command produces a result (like data from an HTTP call or a timer tick), that result is sent back to your `Update` function as a new `Message`.

```go
// Example: A command to make an HTTP request
func fetchDataCmd(url string) terminusgo.Cmd {
	return func() terminusgo.Msg {
		// Perform HTTP GET
		// resp, err := http.Get(url)
		// ... handle error ...
		// body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
		// return DataLoadedMsg{Data: string(body)} // This message will be sent to Update
		return nil // Placeholder
	}
}

// In Update:
case "load":
    return c, fetchDataCmd("https://api.example.com/data")

case DataLoadedMsg: // Custom message type
    c.model.data = msg.Data
    return c, nil
```

Common commands might include:
*   `terminusgo.Quit`: Shuts down the application.
*   `terminusgo.Tick(duration, func() Msg)`: Sends a message after a duration (for timers, animations).
*   Custom commands for I/O.

---

**Advanced Concepts (Brief Overview)**

*   **Managing Multiple Components / Views:**
    *   **Composition:** Your main component's model can contain instances of other components (or their models). Its `Update` and `View` methods would delegate to these children.
    *   **View Switching:** Your model could have a field like `currentView` (e.g., "dashboard", "settings"). The `View()` method would render different UIs based on this, and `Update()` would handle transitions.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Handled via Commands. A command performs the async work and then sends a message back to `Update` with the result.
*   **Global State / Context:** For sharing data across many components without prop-drilling, you might adapt patterns similar to React Context or Redux, managing a global model that relevant components can subscribe to or receive parts of.

**What's Next?**

This guide provides a starting point for TerminusGo. As you build, you'll discover patterns for managing complex applications, creating reusable widgets, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with text-based UIs in the browser.

Happy Hacking with TerminusGo!
